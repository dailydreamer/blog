前段时间在Edx上浏览了一门课程[Mobile Application Experiences](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+21W.789.1x+1T2016/info)，听课笔记记录如下。

## Come up an idea

### Research method

1. observation
2. location tour: park, office...
3. contextual inquiring: working, workout...
4. think aloud
5. diary logging: taking photo, recording video... close to the time that happened
6. interview: ask last time they do something rather than the general situation

look at what they are frustrating to do. What kind of role the environment is playing.

### Analyze data

1. flow models: analyze how data flow transfer between subjects
2. conversation analyze: look at the conversation of subjects related to a subject
3. critical incident analyze: look at the place where people get stuck
4. affinity analyze

#### Affinity analyze

From data(bottom up) to find themes.
It cannot help you to prove a particular hypothesis because you only talk to a few people which can represent everyone.

This method is about discovery, not preconceived notions.

1. Create Note: each post represent one idea.
2. Put up note
3. Use 3 hierarchies, users' exact quotes, users' one sentence summary, theme similar between users.
4. Group the notes use the similar theme
5. Come up with a design through the theme

### Identifying gaps

listen from different source and board audience

build a quick prototype and give it to them

### Proposal

1. why you think the project need to be done
2. what your objects and design elements are
3. how do you test your projects if they have meet your objects.

remember to allow people to navigate through your proposal easily

## Build and test your idea with paper prototype

### Concept modeling

1. before + after: how is life different with your app
1. user mental model: how do user think about the key part of your app
1. architecture model
1. user types
1. content types
1. service model: what are all the user touch point with your system

### User cases

### Structure(flow)

How your product empower people's work flow.

### Screen design

1. where I am, where to go, how to get here
2. set expectations and provide feedback
3. ergonomic design
4. rely on recognition rather than recall

## Paper prototype

start with paper: people tend to critical of overall concept

then mock up screens: people tend to critical on design details

## Usability testing

about 5 people can cover 80% situations

Role: moderator, computer, note taker and user.
